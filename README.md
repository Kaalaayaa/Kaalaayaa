## About Me 📚
Full-Stack Developer with previous junior industry experience in Berlin, currently advancing my software engineering training at **42 Berlin**, a project-based school focused on algorithms, systems programming, low-level development in C and peer learning.

I have previous experience building web applications with React and Next.js, and I’m eager to apply these skills again through personal and collaborative projects. At 42, I’m also learning C and algorithmic exercises while strengthening my overall software engineering abilities.
